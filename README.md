# Waste-Cleanup
Our final repository for computer engineer 288. This will hold the Roomba code that exists to match RoombaController.

When you clone the repository in order to get access to the Roomba controller immediately run:
```
git submodule init
git submodule update --recursive --remote
``` 
Or alternatively when cloning run
```
git clone --recursive https://github.com/ckugel/Waste-Cleanup.git
```
